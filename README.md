The Cinema Ticket Booking System is a SQL-based database project that simulates the backend of an online movie ticket booking platform. The project is designed to efficiently manage movie listings, theatres, show schedules, seat availability, customers, and ticket bookings using a relational database.
This repository contains a complete SQL script that creates the database schema and supports analytical queries for understanding booking trends and cinema performance.

Seats – Maintains seat availability and booking status.

Customers – Stores customer information.

Bookings / Tickets – Records ticket booking details including seats, show, and pricing.

📈 SQL Analytics Included : 

The project includes SQL queries for analysis such as:

Total tickets booked per movie.

Revenue generated per theatre or show.

Most popular movies and time slots.

Seat occupancy and availability analysis.

Customer booking behavior insights.

These queries help demonstrate data analysis and reporting skills using SQL.
